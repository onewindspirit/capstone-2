# Max Anderson - RDSI Capstone Project 

## Proposals

1. **Image Texture Classification:** My first proposal for capstone 2 is to initiate a model for image multi-classification of images intended for texturing 3D models. I plan to scrape a large group of image textures from various sources on the web and classify them by use-case ie. terrain, wood, architectural, character, etc. Places Iâ€™ve found where I can draw these images from are:
    - [Texture Haven](https://texturehaven.com/textures/)
    - [Texture-Resource](https://www.textures-resource.com/)  
    - [SMW Central](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&s=sm64textures)
2. **Facial Detection Classification:** Another idea I had for capstone 2 is to create and train a model to determine if an image of a human face is real or fabricated using 3 image sets: One of drawings of human faces, one of computer generated faces, and the third of photographs of real human faces.

   - [Real faces](https://www.kaggle.com/atulanandjha/lfwpeople)
3. **Animal Image classification:** My last proposal is to build another image classification model around a dataset of images of animal faces, classifying them under various contexts like predator/prey, mammal/reptile/amphibian/bird,etc.
